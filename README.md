# AutoFiller

## Problem Statement

Many job portals still donâ€™t have any AI auto-form completion; even if they do, they fail on
resumes made with templates. This causes job applicants to fill out and correct the forms,
creating a time-consuming activity.

## Description

This project is dedicated to creating an OCR software that recognizes text and patterns on
resumes and CVs to auto-complete application forms. It is found that many job applicants
bounce off job portals with manual forms, so to address this problem we will parse out their
resumes.

## Proposed Solution 

Create an OCR-based AI model, trained on multiple templates from the internet which can
parse resumes and can fill out the information like Name, Email Address and Phone Number.
